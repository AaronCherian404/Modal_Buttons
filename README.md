# Modal_Buttons

This program consists of 3 buttons which open a modal window. 
The modal window can be removed by:
1) clicking on the 'close' button (X)
2) clicking anywhere on the overlay
3) pressing the ESC key

Run the index.html file to experiance the magic!

The code, css and html file are inspired by similar codes written by Jonas Schmedtmann.
